Pipelined 32-bit MIPS Processor.
Designed and implemented a 5-stage pipelined 32-bit MIPS processor in Verilog. Developed Instruction Fetch, Decode,
Execute, Memory, and Write Back stages. Supported R-type and I-type instructions with efficient datapath and control
unit design. Verified functionality using RTL simulation in Vivado.
